## A basic portfolio

This portfolio was made as part of an assignment at Hyper Island. We were tasked with building a portfolio using Next.js, React, and Storyblok.

## Biggest Challenges

- Understanding how Next and Storyblok work together.
- Storyblok doesn't really have a console, so it's hard to catch silent errors
- Formatting content from storyblok

## Biggest Learnings

- I learned to (sometimes) slow down and try to force myself to plan before I start coding.
- I practiced asking coding questions. You really have to think about how to formulate a question properly in order to help others be able to help you.
- Always check to make sure your letter casing matches when naming things in multiple places!
